My code for the FBLA Computer Game &amp; Simulation Programming Competition.

All C# scripts for my game entered in the FBLA Computer Game & Simulation Programming competition at the National Leadership Conference in 2020. Functions include button actions, player actions and movement, interactions with other characters, background system mechanics, game mechanics such as teleportation, and more.
